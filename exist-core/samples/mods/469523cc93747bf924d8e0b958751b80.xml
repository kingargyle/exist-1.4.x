        <title>Renaissance of the German Carmakers during the 1990s:
            Successful Japanization or the Development of a Genuine
            Business Model?</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <abstract>This chapter aims at explaining the renaissance of
            the three German carmakers within the context of the
            international automobile industry. The main argument is that
            this revival can only be understood by referring to some
            common elements of the business models in place at all three
            companies. These business models include four basic pillars,
            each of which answers a basic question at the core of the
            firms  activities: (1) the corporate structure and profit
            strategies, (2) product structure and market strategies, (3)
            the production system and (4) the labour relations regime.
            A business model could thus be understood as the specific
            configuration of structures and strategies in these four
            activity fields and transformation spaces. This
            configuration does not represent a deterministic and fixed
            system but a sort of loosely coupled 'regime of affinity'.</abstract>
